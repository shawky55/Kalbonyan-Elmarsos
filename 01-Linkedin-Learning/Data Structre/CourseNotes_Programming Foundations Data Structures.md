Course Title: Programming Foundations: Data Structures

- Description: Once you get past simple programs with one or two variables, you'll use data structures to store the values in your applications. Data structures are like containers—there's one for every kind of data. While structures like arrays and queues are sometimes taken for granted, a deeper understanding is vital for any programmer who wants to know what's going on "under the hood" and understand how the choices they've made impact the performance and efficiency of their applications. In this course, Kathryn Hodge provides an in-depth overview of the most essential data structures for modern programming. Starting with simple ways of grouping data, like arrays and structs, Kathryn gradually introduces more complex data structures, such as linked lists, stacks and queues, hash tables, and trees and graphs. Each lesson is accompanied by a real-world, practical example that shows the data structures in action. When you're finished with the course, you'll have a clear understanding of data structures and understand how to use them—in whatever language you're programming in: C#, Swift, JavaScript, Java, Python, and more.


- Data => information stored or processed in computer 

- Data is classified with data types based on it is Value 

- Data Types :An attribute of data that describes the values it can be have and how the data can be used 


- Primitive Data Types: have fixed size that not depend on the data inside of them                                                                    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Data Structures** are containers , They allow us to combine several pieces of data into a single structure. If you've ever been to the container store, you'll know there are a lot of different ways to organize things.
-  There are containers that are wide, containers that are tall, skinny, and short. 
- There are containers with different types of bins and organizers with different types of inserts.
-  There are a lot of different ways to organize your stuff with various containers, and there are a lot of different ways we can store and organize our data with different data structures. 
- Data structures are made up of pieces of data, so those ints and doubles and booleans and characters we were talking about before, and have a specialized way and format of organizing and storing these pieces 

- Data  structures give us organization ,storage ,and access in different way to work with data in efficinet manner 

-------------------------------------

- Primitve data type have fixed size so it stores in conseutive bit beacuse we know excaty amount of data it might take 
- but data sturcure hanv not fixed size it takes or might take in the future so we use poniter instead of storing data structre directly os set of consecutive bit we create address that will point to where the sturctre or sometiomes part of stuctre of sturcre is sotred

# 2nd lecture of Data structre

- **Associative Array**:Collection of key-value paris (key:value)

- **Collision**:Anytime two inputs produce the same hash value
- **Hash Table**:is an implementation of the  associative array abstract data structure
